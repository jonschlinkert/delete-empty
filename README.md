> Recursively delete all empty folders in a directory and child directories.

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
$ npm install --save delete-empty
```

Install with [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com):

```sh
$ yarn add delete-empty
```

## Usage

```js
var deleteEmpty = require('delete-empty');
```

## API

Given the following directory structure, the **highlighted directories** would be deleted.

```diff
foo/
└─┬ a/
-  ├── aa/
  ├── bb/
  │ └─┬ bbb/
  │   ├── one.txt
  │   └── two.txt
-  ├── cc/
-  ├ b/
-  └ c/
```

**async**

```js
deleteEmpty('foo/', function(err, deleted) {
  console.log(deleted);
  //=> ['foo/aa/', 'foo/a/cc/', 'foo/b/', 'foo/c/']
});
```

**sync**

```js
deleteEmpty.sync('foo/');
```

As with the async method, an array of deleted directories is returned, in case you want to log them out or provide some kind of feedback to the user.

```js
var deleted = deleteEmpty.sync('foo/');
console.log(deleted);
//=> ['foo/aa/', 'foo/a/cc/', 'foo/b/', 'foo/c/']
```

**cli**

```
bin/cli.js [<path>] [--dry-run|-d]
```

* `<path>` - if given, is used as a working directory (otherwise it's cwd)
* `-d, --dry-run` - if given, prevents empty dirs from being removed, outputs them to console instead
